Binaries with photon counts of COVID-19 images. Generated from projections ../covid-projections-no-noise
Projections were normalized to set max{projections} = 1.0, registration probabilities were set to: exp(-normalized_projections).

Format of the data: 

FLOAT LITTLE ENDIAN, 512 projections, 512 rays per projection
EXPOSURE TIME = 1 second
SOURCE_INTENSITY = 5 * 1e2 second^{-1}
SCATTER_INTENSITY = 1e2 second^{-1}
